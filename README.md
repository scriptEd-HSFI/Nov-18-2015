# Session 12 - Nov-18-2015

:sparkles: ScriptEd HSFI 2015 Yearbook :sparkles:

We will be creating a yearbook TOGETHER for our awesome class! Today you will be practicing how to use git commands (git add, git commit, git branch, git push) and the Github interface to collaborate with each other! You'll also get in some CSS practice along the way. Woooo!

Summary: 
Create a profile for yourself using the template html by adding a yearbook quote, a picture (optional) and some styles! When you are done, submit your html file to the yearbook (this repository) by **pushing your branch** and **opening a pull request**. Grab someone else in the class to give you code review (get a :thumbsup:!), and then **merge your pull request** to add your profile to the yearbook!
