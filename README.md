# Session 12 - Nov-18-2015

:sparkles: ScriptEd HSFI 2015 Yearbook :sparkles:

We will be creating a yearbook TOGETHER for our awesome class! Today you will be practicing how to use git commands (git add, git commit, git branch, git push) and the Github interface to collaborate with each other! You'll also get in some CSS practice along the way. Woooo!

Summary: 
Create a profile for yourself using the template html by adding a yearbook quote, a picture (optional) and some styles! When you are done, submit your html file to the yearbook (this repository) by **pushing your branch** and **opening a pull request**. Grab someone else in the class to give you code review (get a :thumbsup:!), and then **merge your pull request** to add your profile to the yearbook!

Steps: (READ THESE THROUGH ONCE AND THEN START!)

###Set your your branch: 
1. Clone this repository in Cloud 9
2. Create a new branch called feature/{firstname-lastname-profile} that will be the home for your new work. ex: feature/grace-tan-profile
  - git checkout -b feature/{firstname-lastname-profile} 
3. Create a new file with the name: {firstname-lastname}-profile.html. ex: grace-tan-profile.html
4. Copy the html in template.html into your new file.

###Get working: 
5. Start working on adding a picture and a yearbook phrase to your profile!
6. Style your profile so it looks :heart-eyes: beautiful :heart-eyess:

###Finish up: 
7. Add all of your files and create a commit
  - git add {filename}
  - git commit -m "my profile"
8. Push up your branch for review!
  - git push origin feature/{firstname-lastname-profile} 
9. Open a pull request in this page.
10. Grab someone to comment on your pull request and give you a thumb! (thumb means it's good to be merged!)
11. Merge your pull request by clicking the merge button! 
12. PROFIT!
